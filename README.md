# GatherPoint: A Campus Event Management System
A web app for students, faculty, and staff to create, manage, and register for campus events. 
Features include event calendars, notifications, attendee tracking, and feedback collection. 

## Technologies Utilized

### Docker and Postgres
Currently, using Postgres with Docker. Postgres was the database service used in the example 
code when creating an example container for Deliverable 3 to practice deploying images from GitHub.
We've had issues connecting the database to MySQL Workbench, but it runs and functions fine otherwise.
DockerHub has been used for testing and pulling images as well as tags for deployment. 

### Render
We currently plan to use Render for uploading a functional image of our web app. 
It's a free cloud option that's simple to use and was covered during class.
