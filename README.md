# campus-event-management-system
A web app for students, faculty, and staff to create, manage, and register for campus events. 
Features include event calendars, notifications, attendee tracking, and feedback collection. 

Currently, using Postgres with Docker. Postgres was the database service used in the example 
code when creating an example container for Deliverable 3 to practice deploying images from GitHub.
We've had issues connecting the database to MySQL Workbench, but it runs and functions fine otherwise.
